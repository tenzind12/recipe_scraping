Looking for duplicate rows

    SELECT name, COUNT(name), id FROM recipes GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(name) > 1;



delete unmatching foreign id :

            DELETE FROM nutrition
            WHERE NOT EXISTS (
                SELECT *
                FROM recipes
                WHERE recipes.nutritionId=nutrition.id
            )
